4/11/2018   Started assignment1.10: Choose your Own Assignment. I chose to implement the Snake Game.
	    I made sure ncurses was working and started looking up some different things you can
	    do with it.
4/15/2018   Implemented the game correctly but there is a bug where the colors blink.
4/17/2018   Fixed the bugs and game is fully implemented.
4/21/2018   Cleaned up some code, same functionality. End assignment1.10
