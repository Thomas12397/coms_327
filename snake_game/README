I chose to create the Snake Game is my "choose your own assignment". The game
starts by the user pressing the 'Spacebar' which starts the game. There is a
delay to make sure the user is ready and the game starts. The user can control
the snake with the 'arrow keys', so the snake can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.
The objective is to eat the red 'F' on the board, which increases the snake's length.
The game ends if the snake runs into itself or touches one of the borders. Have fun!

To run: It is recommended to set the terminal window size to (80 x 24), but not required.
	I also made the screen dynamic, it can be any size but increasing the size 
	decreases the level of difficulty.
	  
	  go into directory: haddy_thomas-assignment1.10
	  make
	  ./snake
	  make clean
