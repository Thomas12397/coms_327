My program now includes a movable PC, staircases to new, random dungeons, and a monster list that
displays the monsters position relative to the PC. When the PC enter a staircase, it essentially
generates a new dungeon for the PC. I used the number pad to move the PC, so the numbers 1-9 
move it. Possible keyboard keys: 1-9, m, Q, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW, esc. When the game is over,
I have the terminal sleep for 5 seconds so the user can see how they died in the game. To test
the scroll, you might need to change my MONSTERS macro at the top of my code.
My program should meet all of the specifications stated.

To run: It is recommended to set the terminal window size to (80 x 24), but not required.

	  make
	  ./dungeon --play
	  make clean
