1/20/2018  Started assignment1.01: Make a dungeon. Created the boundary lines and random rooms
1/21/2018  Started adding to the room generator to also create the corridors that would
	   connect to each room
1/22/2018  Changed the algorithm for generating rooms and corridors to make it more efficient.
	   Originally, it would place them completely randomly which at times created a much
	   longer runtime than desired.
1/22/2018  Finished programming the requirements for assignment1.01.

1/29/2018  Started assignment1.02: Save and load. Made changes to program by making global 
	   variables so I can make changes to the whole dungeon. Also included a shuffle to 
	   make the corridors more "exciting".
1/30/2018  Attmpted to make a save and load but found problems loading other people's dungeons
	   and ran into many bugs. Moving on to the next assignment. End assignment1.02
	   
2/4/2018   Started assignment1.03: Add a pathfinding algorithm to map out the path for the monsters.
	   Added the PC symbol to the genDungeon() function. Also added a flag "--dijk" in main.
2/5/2018   Made the much needed change and made the dungeon and hardness as global variables. I made
	   a lot more comments to my program to hopefully help myself and the TA's. This also fixed
	   the bugs with save and load so it now functions as desired.
2/12/2018  Started to create the pathfinding algorithm that would be used for the monsters. Ran
	   into problems with the monsters who could not tunnel. Finished the tunneling one.
2/13/2018  Fixed the issue of printing the nontunneling monsters. End assignment1.03

2/17/2018  Started assignment1.04: Make the monsters.
2/18/2018  Changed up some functions from 1.03 to make it so you can generate the distance maps
	   without printing it to the console. Also did some testing with the PC random movement.
2/19/2018  Started making the monsters move towards the PC. More testing to make it work as
	   specified.
2/20/2018  Finished making the monsters move toward the PC. Added flag '--mons' to run the program.
	   End assignment1.04

2/21/2018  Made a couple style fixes like changed monster icons to 'm' and 'M'. Also changed the
	   behavior of the main() function.
2/23/2018  Added the staircases to the dungeons. Also added a moveable PC while testing the common
	   bugs, and fixed them. Need to add a message for game over.
2/24/2018  Added quit. Started to display the monster list below the dungeon first. WIP and pretty
	   buggy.
2/26/2018  Fixed the monster list display and now it displays over the dungeon. Added the scroll
	   feature. End assignment1.05
