1/20/2018  Started assignment1.01: Make a dungeon. Created the boundary lines and random rooms
1/21/2018  Started adding to the room generator to also create the corridors that would
	   connect to each room
1/22/2018  Changed the algorithm for generating rooms and corridors to make it more efficient.
	   Originally, it would place them completely randomly which at times created a much
	   longer runtime than desired.
1/22/2018  Finished programming the requirements for assignment1.01.

1/29/2018  Started assignment1.02: Save and load. Made changes to program by making global 
	   variables so I can make changes to the whole dungeon. Also included a shuffle to 
	   make the corridors more "exciting".
1/30/2018  Attmpted to make a save and load but found problems loading other people's dungeons
	   and ran into many bugs. Moving on to the next assignment. End assignment1.02
	   
2/4/2018   Started assignment1.03: Add a pathfinding algorithm to map out the path for the monsters.
	   Added the PC symbol to the genDungeon() function. Also added a flag "--dijk" in main.
2/5/2018   Made the much needed change and made the dungeon and hardness as global variables. I made
	   a lot more comments to my program to hopefully help myself and the TA's. This also fixed
	   the bugs with save and load so it now functions as desired.
2/12/2018  Started to create the pathfinding algorithm that would be used for the monsters. Ran
	   into problems with the monsters who could not tunnel. Finished the tunneling one.
2/13/2018  Fixed the issue of printing the nontunneling monsters. End assignment1.03

2/17/2018  Started assignment1.04: Make the monsters.
2/18/2018  Changed up some functions from 1.03 to make it so you can generate the distance maps
	   without printing it to the console. Also did some testing with the PC random movement.
2/19/2018  Started making the monsters move towards the PC. More testing to make it work as
	   specified.
2/20/2018  Finished making the monsters move toward the PC. Added flag '--mons' to run the program.
	   End assignment1.04

2/21/2018  Made a couple style fixes like changed monster icons to 'm' and 'M'. Also changed the
	   behavior of the main() function.
2/23/2018  Added the staircases to the dungeons. Also added a moveable PC while testing the common
	   bugs, and fixed them. Need to add a message for game over.
2/24/2018  Added quit. Started to display the monster list below the dungeon first. WIP and pretty
	   buggy.
2/26/2018  Fixed the monster list display and now it displays over the dungeon. Added the scroll
	   feature. End assignment1.05
	   
3/14/2018  Started assignment1.06: Porting to c++ and fog of war. Successfully ported c code to c++.
3/17/2018  Implemented Fog of War. There is a bug in the situation where a monster comes into view,
	   then the PC moves away from it so there is a duplication of the monster.
3/18/2018  Implemented teleporting. Works as specified. Fog of War has another bug where it
	   remembers the PC's last teleport location. Need to add case for teleporting to a border.
3/19/2018  Every bug is fixed besides not being able to teleport to a border. Also cleaned up a lot
	   of my code by putting them into functions rather than inside of keyboardListener().
3/20/2018  Fixed the last bug. End assignment1.06

3/22/2018  Cleaned up a lot of code from 1.06. Added variable to PC to detect if it has moved.
	   This was done to avoid a lot of recursion with the keyboard listener and looks cleaner.
3/24/2018  Started assignment1.07: Parsing monsters. Added the file that would be read from
3/25/2018  Successfully parsed a monster and outputted its attributes. End assignment1.07
3/27/2018  Found an error with DESC where it needs to be towards the beginning for the monsters.
	   Also decided to implement the object parser because I got bored.
	   
3/29/2018  Started assignment1.08: Loading Monsters and Objects. Massive overhaul to my code
	   to become dynamic and able to parse in monsters. Monsters are now displayed on the
	   terminal.
3/31/2018  Implemented monsters fully with randomly choosing them and started implementing
	   objects into the dungeon. Also made converters from string to respective values
	   such as color and dice values.
4/1/2018   Finished implementing the objects and monsters into the game. End assignment1.08

4/7/2018   Started assignment1.09: PC Equipment and Updated Combat. Made some small changes and
	   added the ability to pick up items. Made PC have an inventory and equipment.
4/9/2018   Added in the command for everything to do with the PC's carry inventory
4/10/2018  Added in the commands related to the PC's equipment. Also made it so the PC 
	   automatically picks up the items. End assignment1.09
