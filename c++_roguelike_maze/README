My program now includes the ability to use PC Equipment and updated the combat in the game. Now
if you beat the boss, Spongebob Squarepants, the game ends with the PC victorious. If you use 
one of this week's commands, I have it set so once the command is finished, it goes back to 
the menu it was at. To exit the menu to the dungeon, press 'ESC'. Teleporting is now the 'g'
command. The only command I did not implement was the 'L' command. Everything else should be 
working as specified.

To run: It is recommended to set the terminal window size to (80 x 24), but not required.
	  
	  go into directory: haddy_thomas-assignment1.09
	  make
	  ./main --play
	  make clean
	  
PS: If you want to look at the monsters or objects being parsed use:
	  ./main --parse_mon
	  ./main --parse_obj
	  
DISCLAIMER: My program will not work unless the monster_desc.txt and object_desc.txt are
	    present inside of $HOME/.rlg327. Let me know if there are problems with running.
